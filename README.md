# Collude.It
AMP stack small team interaction platform

Practice with AMP stack development with Bootstrap.

"Small team collaboration. Built by our team, for your team."

# How To Use

The current version of Collude.it runs on the localhost and requires the user to use phpMyAdmin to create a new database called collude_it. To initialize, run the sql file initialize.sql on collude_it. This will set up the needed schemas. From here the website will automaticly add entries into the database as the user interacts with the site.
